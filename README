The only thing we are going to sync is your vimrc.
We will not sync Vundle bundles or even Vundles itself. We'll let Vundles manage all of that. So,
don't let git manage your %HOME%/vimfiles/bundle folder, exclude it with .gitignore



Installation:

    To install this vim on a new computer, do:

    setup an environment variable HOME which points to a directory for
    example username\home\
    
    create "vimfiles" directory in %HOME% 

    clone remote "vimfiles" content into your local vimfiles-dir

    cd %HOME%
    git clone git@github.com:ma65p/vim.git %HOME%/vimfiles


    create a "vimrc" file in %HOME% that points to a "_vimrc" (that
    actually contains all your settings) file 
    in the "vimfiles"-directory

    optionally if you have an extra gvimrc, you do the same thing with that file
    REASON: Vim continues looking for "_vimrc"/"_gvimrc"

    Then install Vundle for Windows by following the instructions
    on the site https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim/wiki/Vundle-for-Windows

    Then open vim or mvim to install the bundles. Hopefully the warning disappear after bundles are installed

    vim
    :PluginInstall

    Once all bundles are installed, restart vim or mvim to see the magic. Notes are left in the vimrc for guidance on what's happending

General Notes

    If plugins are not managed by bundles should be installed as submodule if is manged by git

    git submodule add [git path] [local path]
    
    submodules explanation: keep a git repo inside a git repo
